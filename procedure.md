Follow these steps to determine the Removal of Hardness of Water by Ion Exchange Column:

1. Fill the burette with N/20 K₂Cr₂O₇.
2. Take 25 ml of ferrous ammonium sulphate solution.
3. Add 5 ml H₂SO₄.
4. Place a small drop of the indicator on a white glazed tile.
5. Run into dichromate from the burette into the titration flask, 1 ml at a time with constant shaking/swirling.
6. Now withdraw a drop at mixture from the flask with a thin glass rod and mix it with one drop of indicator on the tile (i.e., outside the titration flask).
7. If a blue color appears, it means the end point has not yet been reached.
8. Now add another 1 ml dichromate and again test it with the indicator until no blue color is obtained. The reading of the burette at this point will give the volume required for oxidation.
9. Repeat the titration for concordant readings.

#### **Safety Precautions**

1. Titrate with 1 ml at a time.
2. Operate burette with carefully.
