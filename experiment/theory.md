### **Introduction**

Potassium dichromate acts as an oxidizing agent (E⁰_red = +1.33 V) in the presence of an acid, and each molecule of it gives up three atoms of oxygen available for oxidation of the reducing agent. Potassium dichromate is a primary standard and is less powerful as an oxidizing agent than KMnO₄ (E⁰_red = +1.33 V). The oxidizing character of these species depends on the pH of the solution. KMnO₄ acts as an oxidizing agent in acidic, basic, and neutral media, but has the strongest oxidizing character in acidic medium. Unlike KMnO₄, K₂Cr₂O₇ behaves as an oxidizing agent only in acidic medium according to the following reaction:

<center>
 K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Cr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + 3[O]
 </center>


When acidic K₂Cr₂O₇ is added an iron ore sample containing Fe²⁺ ions, Fe²⁺ gets oxidized to Fe³⁺ ions according to the following reaction:

<center>
 K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Cr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + 3[O]
 </center>

In this titration, K₃Fe(CN)₆ is used as an external indicator. It gives a blue color upon reaction. If ferrous ions (Fe²⁺) are present, a strong blue color is developed due to:
<center>
2K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] + FeSO<sub>4</sub> → Fe<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>2</sub> + 3K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
</center>

At the end point, no Fe²⁺ ions are present in the solution, so the indicator fails to produce a blue color.
